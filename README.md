# Berlin By Demand

### Tourism app created with the Google Maps API

This aplication is my fullstack final project for the Spiced Academy coding bootcamp. <br>
The main goal behind this project was to work more with React and RESTful APIs, while creating a single page application that also contains a database. Coming from a multimedia design background, making a simple yet functional and pleasant to look at user interface was a big motivation as well.
A few npm modules such as **@react-google-maps/api** were used to help me navigating the Google Maps API together with the offical documentation in the short period of one week.<br>
Technologies used: ES6 Javascript, React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, HTML and CSS.<br><br> 
The gifs below show the app functionality, if you would like to test it yourself please go to [this link](https://berlinbydemand.herokuapp.com/) <br><br>
